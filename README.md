        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to know who the pro tennis coaching staff are.  
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to know which surface(s) you can play on.

        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to contact the site owner with any questions I may have.

  - ##### Frequent User Goals

        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check the timetable for any updates and/or changes.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check for new blogs or social media.  
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes.

- ###  Design

  - #### Color Scheme
    - The three main colours used are green, grey and white.

  - #### Typography
    - I’ve chosen [Google font Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text_type=custom#about) serious but friendly and a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. I used classical proportions (evident in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness.

  - #### Imagery
    - Imagery is essential and needed to be modern but appeal to all users with an engaging can do feel.
