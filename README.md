        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to contact the site owner with any questions I may have.

  - ##### Frequent User Goals

        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check the timetable for any updates and/or changes.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check for new blogs or social media.  
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes.

- ###  Design

  - #### Color Scheme
    - The three main colours used are green, grey and white.
    - ![#1EBBA3](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1EBBA3/000000?text=+) `#1EBBA3`
    - ![#505962](https://via.placeholder.com/15/505962/000000?text=+) `#505962`
    - ![#fff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fff/000000?text=+) `#fff`
   

  - #### Typography
    - Iâ€™ve chosen [Google font Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text_type=custom#about) is a serious but friendly typeface that may seem quite 'transparent' when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. I used classical proportions (evident in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness.

  - #### Imagery
    - Imagery is essential and needed.  It gives a modern appeal to all users with an engaging can do feel.

- ### Wireframes
    - To create the wireframes for my website I used Balsamic.  I started with a basic wireframe for desktop and followed this for the tablet and mobile designs.  I made the decision to go for a one page website with an additional login page.  My website is accessible, easy to navigate and can scroll though the website with ease.  

    The wireframes include:

  - Desktop Wireframe - [View](https://github.com/PhilipWilliams0/BeckenhamTennisBTC/blob/main/assets/wireframe/desktopwireframe.pdf)
