   - ###  Design 
     
      - #### Color Scheme 
         -   The three main colours used are green, grey and white. 
   
      - #### Typography
         - I’ve chosen [Google font Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text_type=custom#about) serious but friendly and a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. I used classical proportions (evident in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness.
    
      - #### Imagery
         - Imagery is essential and needed to be modern but appeal to all users with an engaging can do feel.
